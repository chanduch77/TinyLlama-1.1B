"TinyLlama-1.1B", which seems to involve programming scripts and potentially integrating with some kind of API or local server setup, you'll want a README that clearly outlines the project's complexities, setup instructions, usage, and contribution guidelines. Here’s a structured template for your README.md file:


TinyLlama-1.1B

Welcome to the TinyLlama-1.1B project! This repository contains scripts and configurations necessary for setting up and interfacing with local instances of machine learning models. The project is designed to help developers and researchers quickly bootstrap and test large language models locally using LM Studio.

Project Overview

TinyLlama-1.1B is a set of Python scripts that interface with locally hosted AI models. The core functionality includes testing AI responses, streamlining local development processes, and providing tools for comprehensive logging and debugging.

 Features

- Local API Testing: Scripts to test API endpoints of local servers mimicking cloud-based AI services.
- Model Interaction: Facilitates interaction with models loaded in LM Studio for immediate feedback and development.
- Complex Error Handling: Implements advanced error handling techniques to manage and debug common issues encountered during local development with AI models.

 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the TinyLlama-1.1B project on your local machine.

Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

 Installation

1. Clone the repository**
   
   git clone https://github.com/chanduch77/TinyLlama-1.1B.git
   cd TinyLlama-1.1B
   ```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment**
  
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   

3.Install required packages**
 
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

 Configuration

Edit the `config.json` (example provided in the repo) to match your local environment settings for the models and API endpoints.

Usage

Here’s how to start using TinyLlama-1.1B:

1. Start LM Studio locally**
   - Ensure LM Studio is running and your models are loaded.

2. Run the test script**
   
   python3 local_api_test.py
  

3. Check output**
   - Outputs are logged in the terminal and can be redirected to log files for further analysis.
